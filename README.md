# Quicksilver

## Introduction
A scalable, easy-to-use, lightweight file transfer &amp; detection system that uses both bluetooth and WLAN. Currently supports windows.

## Getting Started
### REQUIREMENTS
If you are using the pre-packaged EXE version, the only installation you would have to complete is that of a 64 bit version of Python 3.12.6 or higher.

If you planning to clone the source code and make your own modifications, be sure to run in your shell or terminal:
```
cd C:/full/cloned/repo/path
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Issue Tracker
- The IP broadcast function is raw and has issues regarding platform detection (currently non-existent) and IP validation. This will be fixed after the main app has been developed.
